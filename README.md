# AWS Policy Project

This project is designed to run in a Docker container. Below are the steps to build and run the application using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
 - Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download them from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to run application.
 - Maven installed on your system. You can download it from the [Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for tests.
 - Postman installed on your system. You can download it from the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing the API.
 - installed on your system. You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository.
## Cloning the Repository
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Run the following command:
 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/peter20011/AWS_POLICY.git
  ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
 ```bash
  cd aws-policy-project
  ```

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

2. Build the Docker image and spin up the container by running:
 ```bash
  docker-compose up 
 ```
It may take a few minutes to download the required images and build the application.

3. Once the container is running, the application will be accessible via:
 ```bash
  http://localhost:8082/api/policy/validate <-- POST request with JSON body in Postman
   
  http://localhost:8082/api/policy/validateFile <-- POST request with file upload in Postman (make your own file with .json extension and upload it in Postman)
 ```
4. To stop and remove the containers, use:
 ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

Please note that the applicationâ€™s services and dependencies are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Running the Tests Locally
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory where the `pom.xml` file is located.
2. Run the following command:
 ```bash 
  mvn test
 ```
This will run the tests and display the results in the terminal.
